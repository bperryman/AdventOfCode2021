# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2021 problems.

Here are some general notes about this:

* The solutions are held in folders, one per day.
* Solutions are in common lisp - if you have ever used a system like
  common lisp you'll know why this makes sense.
* I will try and solve these on they day they are released but I may
  not end up solving all the problems due to time or other
  constraints.
* Any code here is not in anyway production quality, error handling
  will generally be skipped and certain conditions will be assumed and
  not tested for - this is supposed to be fun after all.
